# historical_stock_data

This app takes some stock data as input (Stock name, dates and user email) and outputs a chart with the stock data, after going through an external API.
Been having some issues while receiving recent data, I think the endpoint does not allow me to get the latest data.

TODOs:
Organise the frontend code a bit better, 
Implement the email functionality, ideally in a queue, 
General code cleanup
